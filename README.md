# M.E.R.N Real Estate

Welcome to the M.E.R.N Real Estate repository! This full-stack application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It features a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing real estate houses for both rent and sale, as well as user management.

## Technologies Used

- **React (TypeScript):** The frontend is built with React using TypeScript, providing a scalable and statically-typed development environment.

- **Node.js (JavaScript):** The backend server is powered by Node.js, offering a fast and scalable runtime for building server-side applications.

- **Express.js:** The backend utilizes Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, to handle routing and middleware.

- **MongoDB:** The application stores data in MongoDB, a NoSQL database, ensuring flexibility and scalability for real estate data.

## Features

- **Real Estate CRUD:** Manage real estate listings with full CRUD operations. Create, update, and delete property listings for both rent and sale.

- **User Management:** Implement user authentication and authorization, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
